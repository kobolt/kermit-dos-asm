# kermit-dos-asm
Kermit protocol receiver program for DOS in 16-bit x86 assembly.
Based on the "Baby Kermit" BASIC program found in the official kermit documentation.

Can be used to transfer files over the serial port to an older computer with DOS. But only in one direction, and currently only at 9600 baud. I recommend to use this to transfer the [real full-feature MS-DOS Kermit program](http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/mskermit.html) to the computer.
